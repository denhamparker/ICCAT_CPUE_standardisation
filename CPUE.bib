@article{Struyf1997,
abstract = {This paper describes the incorporation of seven stand-alone clustering programs into S-PLUS, where they can now be used in a much more flexible way. The original Fortran programs carried out new cluster analysis algorithms introduced in the book of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). These clustering methods were designed to be robust and to accept dissimilarity data as well as objects-by-variables data. Moreover, they each provide a graphical display and a quality index reflecting the strength of the clustering. The powerful graphics of S-PLUS made it possible to improve these graphical representations considerably. The integration of the clustering algorithms was performed according to the object-oriented principle supported by S-PLUS. The new functions have a uniform interface, and are compatible with existing S-PLUS functions. We will describe the basic idea and the use of each clustering method, together with its graphical features. Each function is briefly illustrated with an example.},

@article{Tascheri2010,
abstract = {Changing targeting behavior of fishing fleets and zero-catch records of the target species are two characteristics common to many multi-species trawl fisheries. These features complicate analyses intended to produce indices of relative abundance from commercial catch rate data. Trawl catch rates of Patagonian grenadier caught off Southern Chile were used to calculate indices of relative abundance for this species. To allow for targeting behavior and zero catches, we first defined a subset of relevant tows combining a logistic regression on the species catch composition and knowledge about the persistence of Patagonian grenadier in the catches from the area where historically it has been more abundant. A standardization analysis was then conducted on this subset of the data using a generalized linear model (GLM) framework. Analysis of deviance tables and standard residuals GLM diagnostic plots were used for selecting the statistical models that best described the data. The candidate models tested were the delta-lognormal, delta-gamma, quasi-Poisson and compound Poisson. The models that best supported the Patagonian grenadier catch rate data were the delta-lognormal and compound Poisson models. Standardization models were then extended to generalized linear mixed models to include the vessel main effect and the significant interactions with the year effect as random effects. Estimations of the annual series of relative abundance were then obtained from the coefficients of the year effects of these models, both of which showed higher abundance for the years 2001--2008 than in previous years of the series. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Carvalho2010,
abstract = {Distribution and relative abundance of blue sharks (Prionace glauca) in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean was modeled based on catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) per 1000 hooks and length frequencies of blue sharks caught by the Brazilian pelagic tuna longline fleet. As a measure of relative abundance, CPUE of blue sharks caught in 58 238 fishing sets by the Brazilian pelagic tuna longline fleet (national and chartered), from 1978 to 2009, was standardized by a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) using three different approaches: i) a negative binomial error structure (log link); ii) the traditional delta lognormal model; and iii) the Tweedie distribution, recently proposed to adjust models with a high proportion of zeros. A cluster analysis using the K-means method was used to identify target species and incorporate it as a factor into the GLM. Cluster analysis grouped the data into six different fishing clusters according to the percentage of target species. Target factor (cluster) was the most important factor explaining the variance in all three CPUE models. The Tweedie model showed a relatively better fit compared to the other models. Blue shark nominal and standardized CPUE showed a relatively stable trend from 1978 to 1995. From 1995 onwards, however, there was an increasing trend in the standardized CPUE, up to a maximum value in 2008. In general, nominal CPUE and standardized CPUE tracked well up until 2000, after which standardized CPUE's values were at a noticeably lower level than nominal CPUE. Length frequency data were analyzed for 11 932 blue sharks measured as part of the Brazilian onboard observer program operating on the pelagic tuna longline fleet between 2006 and 2008, with sizes ranging from 91 to 224 cm fork length. Overall, blue shark size data showed clear spatial and seasonal distributions for males and females in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, with juveniles predominantly concentrated in the most southerly latitudes.},

@article{He1997,
abstract = {In the Hawaii-based longline fishery, changes in fishing operations to target different species produce changes in the effectiveness of fishing effort units. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used in resource monitoring were improved by segregating dissimilar types of fishing effort. Cluster analysis was used to classify longline sets in relation to species composition of the catches. Based on proportions of eight species and three broader species groups in 46 961 longline sets from 4 years (1991-1994) of commercial fishery data, five effort clusters were identified. Spatial distribution of sets and differences in fishing operations among clusters were then compared to reveal apparent differences in fishing strategies. Three clusters comprised ??? 80{\%} of the total sets, and the catch compositions suggested targeting for either broadbill swordfish (two clusters) or bigeye tuna. The other two clusters were most similar to the tuna cluster, but their catch compositions indicated a mixed-species fishing strategy. Fishing operations were most different between sets in the tuna and swordfish clusters. Swordfish sets were characterized by (l) the largest vessels, (2) the least number of hooks per set. (3) the greatest number of lightsticks, (4) the longest set duration. (5) the highest percentage of night sets, (6) a larger percentage of sets within the full moon phase, and (7) the lowest percentage of sets within the main Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone. Time series of CPUE for three species (bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and swordfish) based on different clusters were compared, and the most appropriate CPUE time series for resource monitoring are recommended.},

@article{Raiche2013,
abstract = {Most of the strategies that have been proposed to determine the number of components that account for the most variation in a principal components analysis of a correlation matrix rely on the analysis of the eigenvalues and on numerical solutions. The Cattell's scree test is a graphical strategy with a nonnumerical solution to determine the number of components to retain. Like Kaiser's rule, this test is one of the most frequently used strategies for determining the number of components to retain. However, the graphical nature of the scree test does not definitively establish the number of components to retain. To circumvent this issue, some numerical solutions are proposed, one in the spirit of Cattell's work and dealing with the scree part of the eigenvalues plot, and one focusing on the elbow part of this plot. A simulation study compares the efficiency of these solutions to those of other previously proposed methods. Extensions to factor analysis are possible and may be particularly useful with many low-dimensional components.},
